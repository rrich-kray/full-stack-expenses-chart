## Description

This was another Frontend Mentor challenge that I took upon myself to both improve my CSS acumen and get more experience with the Recharts React library.

This is a full-stack version of my Expenses Chart project (linked below), featuring a simple SQL database with a single model for Expenses, and a REST API built with Express.js to fetch the data. Overall this project provided good experience performing a fetch request from within a React component.
